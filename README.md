# Test-Scenarios
As a tester, you can follow these five steps to create Test Scenarios-
Step 1: Read the System Under Test (SUT) Requirement Documents such as BRS, SRS, and FRS.  You might also refer to the application's use cases, books, manuals, and so on.
Step 2: Determine probable user actions and objectives for each need. Determine the requirement's technical characteristics. Determine potential scenarios of system misuse and evaluate users from a hacker's perspective.
Step 3: After reviewing the Requirements Document and conducting your due diligence, create a set of test scenarios that validate each functionality of the product.
Step 4: Once all feasible Test Scenarios have been defined, a Traceability Matrix is constructed to ensure that each and every requirement has a matching Test Scenario.
Step 5: The scenarios created are reviewed by your supervisor. Later, they are also reviewed by other Stakeholders in the project.
